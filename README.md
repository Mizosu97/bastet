! PLEASE READ ! After installation DO NOT use `sudo pacman -Syu` to update your system. Use `miz system update` instead. Also, installing the `neofetch` package will break the custom neofetch mizOS provides.


mizOS is an operating system that doesnt use the standard ISO image for installation. It uses what's called a "hijack" script, much like Bedrock Linux. It installs on top of a pre-existing OS. mizOS only supports Artix-based operating systems.

The core of mizOS is a script called `miz`. `miz` aims to bring similar syntax across all init systems, as well as some other cool features. It also comes with i3-gaps along with a modified configuration file that adds some nice features.

mizOS currently supports the following init systems:
- Runit
